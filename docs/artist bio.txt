Gary Boodhoo combines videogames, machine learning and interface design to rediscover ancient images â€” spirit animals. Born in Jamaica, his relocation to the United States provided a crash course in how to construct mythology out of the 1980's. Then computers happened and then Dungeons and Dragons happened. Today he designs and bleeds user interfaces for videogames including The Sims and The Elder Scrolls Online. His work examines roleplaying and transformation in digital environments. He lives in San Francisco and develops humane experiences with game studios and other creative clients.
